A python program to optimize images. It uses tinypng's API to achieve this feat

First install all requirements for this script by:
```
pip install -r requirements
```
Then you can simply start the program by executing the GUI.py file as:
```
python GUI.py
```

Note that you'll need an API key from tinify.com/developers to optimize files which you can generate by providing an email inside the app.
Free trial will contain 500 compressions for free per month.
For more compressions you can purchase the package.

Thanks!
